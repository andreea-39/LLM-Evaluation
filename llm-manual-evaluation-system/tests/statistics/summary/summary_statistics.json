Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from", "validity": true}, {"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": true}]}, {"sentence": " It highlights the importance of collaboration among governments, private sectors, and civil society to address growing concerns", "sentence_context_matches": [{"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": false}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue .

As such , cyber resilience should be made part of relevant policies or systems such as a national cyber strategy , an end - to - end criminal justice system , domestic and foreign policy , and laws for the public good . nati onal strategy . Lack of national coordination can lead to redundant policy and legislation , thereby hindering economic growth and development . The Research produced certain recommendations : - E ach nation connected to the Internet should have a c omprehensive and transparent national cyber strategy t hat is integrated and harmonized with the strategies and pr ocedures across all domestic and international policy . - A s each body and organization has a role , it is crucial that t he strategies developed incorporate the private and civil s ectors , as well as leverage economic and security i ssues , among other tools , to drive the adoption of i nitiatives . The focus on incentives driven by the g overnment and independent providers should be enhanced . - F inally , a competent institution is needed to be r esponsible for the successful implementation and rollout o f the national strategy . An identifiable , responsible i nstitution will offer transparency to stakeholders in the p rocess . no t having a resource to consult often leads to c hallenges of ownership , function and action , the r esearch highlighted . End - to - end criminal justice system . \u201c Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless , \u201d a chief information officer ( CIO ) observes in an interview . Indeed , law enforcement needs to have the capability and resources to investigate cybercrimes and to have an appropriate , comprehensive and agile legal code to support its investigative and prosecutorial activities . Cyber resilience is a complex matter that may not be entirely clear to everybody in the criminal justice system . As such , it is critical that legal advocates , either through further education or other training , understand the cyber resilience ecosystem well enough to carry out due process . Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless . Chief information officer of a financial services organisationDomestic policy . no clear consensus emerged in the F orum - McKinsey workshops and dialogues on the nature of public - sector action needed domestically . Based on the background and regulatory history of the participants , it seemed that different sectors had different views on the most beneficial action . As such , two key points are identified : - pr ivate , public and civil dialogue is needed to develop a c oherent mix of policy and market mechanisms for u se in the cyber ecosystem . no t taking a m ultistakeholder approach risks eliciting a mix of r esponses that could be weighted unevenly in one area , r esulting in limited success . - A rapidly changing cyber resilience landscape r equires all government mechanisms to support the e fforts of law enforcement and to be appropriately agile . It was emphasized during a December 2013 r oundtable discussion of partners in Washington DC that a major impediment to potential public - sector actions w ould be a rigid set of codes that did not allow changes t o a highly dynamic sector . Foreign policy . \u201c Cyberattacks have the potential to change the nature of warfare and international relations , almost past the level of the Cold War , \u201d says the CIO of a European aerospace and defence company . It is clear that cyber events are changing the nature of interstate relations . As such , countries should establish a national cyber doctrine to define and express their positions on the use of cyber resilience tools and weapons for national purposes . The workshops and dialogues showed that today different organizations are sharing information and cooperating on cyber actions . Communication , formal and informal , is essential among those investigating , prosecuting and enforcing laws on cybercrime . Making the process transparent can help to cut the confusion and lag in tracking and prosecution . In addition , each level of government is responsible for identifying competent authorities and for creating interoperability among national entities and sovereign legal codes . For businesses to continue to expand , better harmonization of national policies will be needed . All these requirements reiterate the need for a multistakeholder approach to address cyber risks . A primary concern voiced by several institutions is the often - stark differences in requirements for different nations . This challenge can drastically affect the growth of international and local businesses . pub lic good . For the public good , all stakeholders need to ensure that they contribute to and maintain an evolving and robust incident - response capability . This ranges from established programs for information - sharing and incident response such as CERT ( Computer Emergency Readiness Team ) to information training and development of human resources . Such a dynamic space demands an ever - evolving set of capabilities to match the changing pace of the threat . Maintenance includes possible funding for cyber resilience research and greater investment in cyber resilience technical education in order to foster a more cyber - aware workforce . FIGURE 1 : POTE nTIAL ACTIO nS TO IMPROVE InSTITUTIO nAL READI nESS Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World103 . Community Responses In cyber resilience components where public and private interests intersect , it is vital for the community to agree and act as one . This is particularly important for infrastructure , which often accommodates many interests . The community can cooperate on actions such as : research , information - sharing , knowledge transfer , self - governance , sharing resources for capability building , and mutual aid . Research . Cyber resilience or cybersecurity is still a fairly nascent topic , and requires further investment from interested parties to be fully understood and developed . As such , it is important to encourage public - and private - sector efforts to better understand the impact of cyber resilience on enterprises , nations and macroeconomics . This common language development would be helpful in setting priorities and focusing government policies on cyber resilience . Many advancements in this space occurred outside formal institutions . As such , it will be important to create an atmosphere in which counter - attack ( \u201c white - hat hacker \u201d ) research is not only encouraged but also supported financially . Shared resource for capability building . Foster partnerships among governments , universities and the private sector to develop skills in this area . Information - sharing . As one of the core areas of focus identified by the Partnership for Cyber Resilience in 2012 , key recommendations surfaced regarding sharing of information : - W here legally feasible , institutions need to find m echanisms for information - sharing already in existence , e ither formally or informally . - T owards that end , it will be critical to improve the quality of t he ISACs / CERTs / CIERTs and other information - sharing v enues to provide the best variety of options . - T he success of such programs requires the promotion of a n interoperable , extensible and automated system for s haring information . 4 . Systemic Responses A series of actions can greatly improve the quality of conversation on cyber resilience and accelerate coordination . Although thinking on this issue continues to evolve , two areas offer promise in building maturity in the ecosystem : - R isk markets . Making use of a developed cyber risk i nsurance market to trade and monetize the risk from c yber events . - E mbedded security . Exploring options to embed s ecurity parameters earlier into the lifecycle of products , a nd even into contemporary means of communication , s uch as the Internet . Against this backdrop of high - value responses , it is worth noting that another range of actions is likely to deliver low or uncertain value in fostering cyber resilience . For example , while governments may be in a position to disrupt supply chains for attack vectors , such a move by private - sector institutions would seem to be uncertain or counter - productive because of the collateral fallout . For their part , regulators may be able to engage in counter - attacks and service disruptions , but they should be cautious about allowing Internet service providers to engage in similar efforts because of possible reprisals on the overall infrastructure or bystander organizations .11 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness Cyber resilience is becoming a critical business and social issue . As more and more business value and personal information rapidly migrates to digital form , the risks from cyberattacks grow ever more daunting . On the front line are public and private institutions that rely on cyber resilience systems and controls to protect intellectual property , information assets and business continuity . Supporting them are regulators who develop the policies to facilitate and defend technology , law enforcement agencies , and industry associations that work to share information and improve institutional security . Defying all of them are cyberattackers , with a wide range of motives and sophisticated tools to access or disrupt cyber services . Criminals pursue financial gain through online fraud or theft of identity . State - sponsored actors engage in online espionage and sabotage . Competitors steal intellectual property or interrupt business to grab advantage . Online \u201c hactivists \u201d pierce firewalls to disturb functions or make political statements . Often , insiders help the external attackers or initiate their own attacks , worsening the odds for institutions . Eliminating threats from sophisticated malevolent players is impossible . Other factors also complicate the response . Open and interconnected technology environments make historic \u201c protect the perimeter \u201d strategies insufficient and , in many cases , counter - productive . As mentioned earlier , much of the damage is caused by inadequate response to the breach , rather than the breach itself . Moreover , mitigating the impact of attacks and ruptures often implies complicated trade - offs between risk reduction and business impact . Large institutions struggle with cyber resilience decisions because quantifying risks and its alleviation is difficult , and getting executive engagement on trade - offs is practically impossible . Cyber resilience is the successful mitigation of the strategic and economic impacts of cyberattacks , and is based on cybersecurity capabilities . This chapter assesses the options for participants in the security ecosystem to increase cyber resilience . These findings are gleaned from the workshops held over 2013 and the interviews with more than 200 industry leaders in seven sectors across the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa , and Asia . 2 The workshops and interviews focused on three topics : practitioner views on the importance of cyber risks ; the impact of attacks on businesses , the effect of cyber risks on investment in research and development ( R & D ) and efforts to mitigate risk ; and potential mitigating actions . The interviews were augmented with survey data that compared cyber resilience capability in large firms with best practices across multiple sectors and regions . Some critical findings from the research include : 1 . For most companies across sectors and regions , cyber resilience is a strategic risk The workshop and interview sessions found that European companies are slightly more concerned than their American counterparts about cyber resilience . The research also indicated that as awareness has grown , chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief technology officers ( CTOs ) are just as concerned as chief Information security officer ( CISOs ) . Practitioners believe cyberattacks are a greater risk than other types of technology risks . Some executives found internal threats to be as big a risk as external attacks ( see Figure 2 ) . Financial institutions are particularly sensitive \u2014 about 80 % of them believe cyber resilience is a \u201c strategic risk \u201d , compared with roughly half of other institutions . \u201c The issue is coming earlier in the conversation , \u201d says the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of a high - tech vendor . \u201c Before , we may not have covered it until the end of the meeting ; now it is the first or second thing companies are asking us about . \u201d ( See Figure 3 . ) The nature of the threat is heavily dependent on sector . \u201c Product \u201d companies , such as those in high technology , are most concerned about industrial espionage . \u201c Services \u201d companies focus on the loss and release of personally identifiable information and service disruption . Concern also exists over interference with business operations over time . For product companies , the leaking of proprietary knowledge about production processes may be more damaging than leaks of product specifications , given the pervasiveness of \u201c tear down \u201d techniques and legal protection for product designs .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from", "validity": false}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region . Simultaneously , the core team will proactively s", "validity": false}, {"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items .

As such , cyber resilience should be made part of relevant policies or systems such as a national cyber strategy , an end - to - end criminal justice system , domestic and foreign policy , and laws for the public good . nati onal strategy . Lack of national coordination can lead to redundant policy and legislation , thereby hindering economic growth and development . The Research produced certain recommendations : - E ach nation connected to the Internet should have a c omprehensive and transparent national cyber strategy t hat is integrated and harmonized with the strategies and pr ocedures across all domestic and international policy . - A s each body and organization has a role , it is crucial that t he strategies developed incorporate the private and civil s ectors , as well as leverage economic and security i ssues , among other tools , to drive the adoption of i nitiatives . The focus on incentives driven by the g overnment and independent providers should be enhanced . - F inally , a competent institution is needed to be r esponsible for the successful implementation and rollout o f the national strategy . An identifiable , responsible i nstitution will offer transparency to stakeholders in the p rocess . no t having a resource to consult often leads to c hallenges of ownership , function and action , the r esearch highlighted . End - to - end criminal justice system . \u201c Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless , \u201d a chief information officer ( CIO ) observes in an interview . Indeed , law enforcement needs to have the capability and resources to investigate cybercrimes and to have an appropriate , comprehensive and agile legal code to support its investigative and prosecutorial activities . Cyber resilience is a complex matter that may not be entirely clear to everybody in the criminal justice system . As such , it is critical that legal advocates , either through further education or other training , understand the cyber resilience ecosystem well enough to carry out due process . Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless . Chief information officer of a financial services organisationDomestic policy . no clear consensus emerged in the F orum - McKinsey workshops and dialogues on the nature of public - sector action needed domestically . Based on the background and regulatory history of the participants , it seemed that different sectors had different views on the most beneficial action . As such , two key points are identified : - pr ivate , public and civil dialogue is needed to develop a c oherent mix of policy and market mechanisms for u se in the cyber ecosystem . no t taking a m ultistakeholder approach risks eliciting a mix of r esponses that could be weighted unevenly in one area , r esulting in limited success . - A rapidly changing cyber resilience landscape r equires all government mechanisms to support the e fforts of law enforcement and to be appropriately agile . It was emphasized during a December 2013 r oundtable discussion of partners in Washington DC that a major impediment to potential public - sector actions w ould be a rigid set of codes that did not allow changes t o a highly dynamic sector . Foreign policy . \u201c Cyberattacks have the potential to change the nature of warfare and international relations , almost past the level of the Cold War , \u201d says the CIO of a European aerospace and defence company . It is clear that cyber events are changing the nature of interstate relations . As such , countries should establish a national cyber doctrine to define and express their positions on the use of cyber resilience tools and weapons for national purposes . The workshops and dialogues showed that today different organizations are sharing information and cooperating on cyber actions . Communication , formal and informal , is essential among those investigating , prosecuting and enforcing laws on cybercrime . Making the process transparent can help to cut the confusion and lag in tracking and prosecution . In addition , each level of government is responsible for identifying competent authorities and for creating interoperability among national entities and sovereign legal codes . For businesses to continue to expand , better harmonization of national policies will be needed . All these requirements reiterate the need for a multistakeholder approach to address cyber risks . A primary concern voiced by several institutions is the often - stark differences in requirements for different nations . This challenge can drastically affect the growth of international and local businesses . pub lic good . For the public good , all stakeholders need to ensure that they contribute to and maintain an evolving and robust incident - response capability . This ranges from established programs for information - sharing and incident response such as CERT ( Computer Emergency Readiness Team ) to information training and development of human resources . Such a dynamic space demands an ever - evolving set of capabilities to match the changing pace of the threat . Maintenance includes possible funding for cyber resilience research and greater investment in cyber resilience technical education in order to foster a more cyber - aware workforce . FIGURE 1 : POTE nTIAL ACTIO nS TO IMPROVE InSTITUTIO nAL READI nESS Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World103 . Community Responses In cyber resilience components where public and private interests intersect , it is vital for the community to agree and act as one . This is particularly important for infrastructure , which often accommodates many interests . The community can cooperate on actions such as : research , information - sharing , knowledge transfer , self - governance , sharing resources for capability building , and mutual aid . Research . Cyber resilience or cybersecurity is still a fairly nascent topic , and requires further investment from interested parties to be fully understood and developed . As such , it is important to encourage public - and private - sector efforts to better understand the impact of cyber resilience on enterprises , nations and macroeconomics . This common language development would be helpful in setting priorities and focusing government policies on cyber resilience . Many advancements in this space occurred outside formal institutions . As such , it will be important to create an atmosphere in which counter - attack ( \u201c white - hat hacker \u201d ) research is not only encouraged but also supported financially . Shared resource for capability building . Foster partnerships among governments , universities and the private sector to develop skills in this area . Information - sharing . As one of the core areas of focus identified by the Partnership for Cyber Resilience in 2012 , key recommendations surfaced regarding sharing of information : - W here legally feasible , institutions need to find m echanisms for information - sharing already in existence , e ither formally or informally . - T owards that end , it will be critical to improve the quality of t he ISACs / CERTs / CIERTs and other information - sharing v enues to provide the best variety of options . - T he success of such programs requires the promotion of a n interoperable , extensible and automated system for s haring information . 4 . Systemic Responses A series of actions can greatly improve the quality of conversation on cyber resilience and accelerate coordination . Although thinking on this issue continues to evolve , two areas offer promise in building maturity in the ecosystem : - R isk markets . Making use of a developed cyber risk i nsurance market to trade and monetize the risk from c yber events . - E mbedded security . Exploring options to embed s ecurity parameters earlier into the lifecycle of products , a nd even into contemporary means of communication , s uch as the Internet . Against this backdrop of high - value responses , it is worth noting that another range of actions is likely to deliver low or uncertain value in fostering cyber resilience . For example , while governments may be in a position to disrupt supply chains for attack vectors , such a move by private - sector institutions would seem to be uncertain or counter - productive because of the collateral fallout . For their part , regulators may be able to engage in counter - attacks and service disruptions , but they should be cautious about allowing Internet service providers to engage in similar efforts because of possible reprisals on the overall infrastructure or bystander organizations .11 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness Cyber resilience is becoming a critical business and social issue . As more and more business value and personal information rapidly migrates to digital form , the risks from cyberattacks grow ever more daunting . On the front line are public and private institutions that rely on cyber resilience systems and controls to protect intellectual property , information assets and business continuity . Supporting them are regulators who develop the policies to facilitate and defend technology , law enforcement agencies , and industry associations that work to share information and improve institutional security . Defying all of them are cyberattackers , with a wide range of motives and sophisticated tools to access or disrupt cyber services . Criminals pursue financial gain through online fraud or theft of identity . State - sponsored actors engage in online espionage and sabotage . Competitors steal intellectual property or interrupt business to grab advantage . Online \u201c hactivists \u201d pierce firewalls to disturb functions or make political statements . Often , insiders help the external attackers or initiate their own attacks , worsening the odds for institutions . Eliminating threats from sophisticated malevolent players is impossible . Other factors also complicate the response . Open and interconnected technology environments make historic \u201c protect the perimeter \u201d strategies insufficient and , in many cases , counter - productive . As mentioned earlier , much of the damage is caused by inadequate response to the breach , rather than the breach itself . Moreover , mitigating the impact of attacks and ruptures often implies complicated trade - offs between risk reduction and business impact . Large institutions struggle with cyber resilience decisions because quantifying risks and its alleviation is difficult , and getting executive engagement on trade - offs is practically impossible . Cyber resilience is the successful mitigation of the strategic and economic impacts of cyberattacks , and is based on cybersecurity capabilities . This chapter assesses the options for participants in the security ecosystem to increase cyber resilience . These findings are gleaned from the workshops held over 2013 and the interviews with more than 200 industry leaders in seven sectors across the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa , and Asia . 2 The workshops and interviews focused on three topics : practitioner views on the importance of cyber risks ; the impact of attacks on businesses , the effect of cyber risks on investment in research and development ( R & D ) and efforts to mitigate risk ; and potential mitigating actions . The interviews were augmented with survey data that compared cyber resilience capability in large firms with best practices across multiple sectors and regions . Some critical findings from the research include : 1 . For most companies across sectors and regions , cyber resilience is a strategic risk The workshop and interview sessions found that European companies are slightly more concerned than their American counterparts about cyber resilience . The research also indicated that as awareness has grown , chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief technology officers ( CTOs ) are just as concerned as chief Information security officer ( CISOs ) . Practitioners believe cyberattacks are a greater risk than other types of technology risks . Some executives found internal threats to be as big a risk as external attacks ( see Figure 2 ) . Financial institutions are particularly sensitive \u2014 about 80 % of them believe cyber resilience is a \u201c strategic risk \u201d , compared with roughly half of other institutions . \u201c The issue is coming earlier in the conversation , \u201d says the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of a high - tech vendor . \u201c Before , we may not have covered it until the end of the meeting ; now it is the first or second thing companies are asking us about . \u201d ( See Figure 3 . ) The nature of the threat is heavily dependent on sector . \u201c Product \u201d companies , such as those in high technology , are most concerned about industrial espionage . \u201c Services \u201d companies focus on the loss and release of personally identifiable information and service disruption . Concern also exists over interference with business operations over time . For product companies , the leaking of proprietary knowledge about production processes may be more damaging than leaks of product specifications , given the pervasiveness of \u201c tear down \u201d techniques and legal protection for product designs .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue .

Relationships between private and public institutions are unformed in many cases . Consensus is limited across industries , and across the private and public sectors . Insurance executives indicate that individual companies and institutions may have the strongest impact in fending off cyber risks . Respondents from the high - tech sector and from the largest corporations \u2013 those with a market cap of more than US $ 50 billion \u2013 indicate that technology vendors may be in a position to have the strongest impact . Similarly , the perception of regulation varies widely , depending on sector . Consensus is lacking on which public - sector actions would be most beneficial . Executives worry that broad agreement regulations can lock in outdated techniques , and that regulators lack the skills and capabilities to provide effective input . Financial - services technology executives say that regulation is actively harmful because it forces a focus on the wrong things . ye t a large proportion of respondents from the healthcare and insurance sectors view regulations as helpful in managing cyber resilience . Healthcare technology executives say regulation is not ideal but remains valuable because it compels senior management to commit attention and resources to security issues . \u201c Institutionally , we can take all the actions we want but the threat will only be reduced when governments and law enforcement agencies are able to take action , \u201d says the CISO of a pharmaceutical company . ( See Figure 10 . ) Traditional approaches also appear increasingly ineffective . In most cases businesses rely mainly on passive measures , typically addressing issues only after they have arisen . Business partners are not sufficiently involved , and policing and application of cyber resilience lack consistent rigour . Responses are often backward looking , require specialized talent that is costly and hard to find , and rely mostly on technology solutions , even though sophisticated agents often attack the weakest link : customers and employees . Still , the research finds near universal agreement among CSOs , CTOs and CISOs that a step - change improvement is needed in their own capabilities to protect their businesses from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats , enable productivity and innovation , and maintain a competitive cost position . Says the CISO of a global bank : \u201c yo u have some at the top and some that are clueless , but the bulk are in the middle and they are behind \u201d ( i . e . below the median ) . Adds the cyber resilience chief of a national law enforcement agency : \u201c Some businesses have really improved their position , but more need to take [ cyber resilience ] as a business issue overall and really need to improve their resilience . \u201d Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 2223 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 10 : IMP ACT OF C yBE R R ESILIE nC E Interview question : What impact does government regulation have on your ability to manage cybersecurity related risks ? % of respondents Banking Healthcare Insurance High - techResponses by sector 63 9 45 19 32 37 45 36 44 40 0 18 18 25 1612 13 0 27 0Aggregate responses 1 2 3 4No / Limited impact On balance it encourages us to be more secure in a helpful way It requires a lot of time and effort , but does not really make us more secure It makes us less secure by requiring actions that do not make sense or taking resources away from higher priority actionsMost frequent response Source : Industry leader interviews ; team analysis , World Economic Forum and McKinsey & CompanyLarge proportion of respondents from healthcare and insurance sectors view regulations as helpful in managing cybersecurityRisk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World24 SC EnA RI oS TESTI nG AT THE Ann U AL ME ETInG oF THE nEW CH AMpIo nS D uring the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of ne w Champions 2013 in Dalian , People \u2019 s Republic of China , senior business leaders and executives convened at a private session to explore current and future potential drivers and trends that will define the cyber ecosystem . They also took a look at how each of the drivers would come together to form four potential scenarios by 2020 : - Sc enario A : Cyber threats increase , but sophistication of i nstitutions does not . Businesses continue to reach the w ay they have in the past and the attack vendors continue t o group together and increase in their relative sophistication . - S cenario B : Fears about cyber security slow down c ooperation and trust . Sophisticated attack vectors are d isseminated to a wider range of actors with some ha rboring truly destructive intent . This ripples into i mplications for consumer purchasing habits , limiting b usiness strategies and severely inhibiting government regulations - Sc enario C : Technology and security become enablers t o growth .

A s eries of highly visible , destructive attacks shake the b edrock of consumer purchasing habits , forcing b usinesses to shift the way the act . Participants discussed the implications of each of the scenarios . Some of the themes that emerged included : - A p ush for new and innovative solutions from third party v endors to help combat newer and more sophisticated threats - A n eed to reformulate business strategy to consider c hanges ranging from countries in which companies feel c omfortable operating in to the way they connected with consumers - A need for greater regional and international cooperation - b etween nations to align regulations as well as prosecute criminals - O pportunities will emerge for new businesses in insurance o r risk markets to help businesses mitigate the potential d ownside from cyber risksParticipants of the Partnership for Cyber Resilience session Christophe ni colas , Senior Vice - President , Kudelski GroupChristopher Mondini , Vice - President , Stakeholder Engagement , n orth America & Global Business Engagement , ICA nn Scott David , Executive Director , Law , Technology and Arts Group , University of Washington Peter Schwartz , Senior Vice - President , Global Government Relations , Salesforce 25 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World Drivers identi / f_ied through interviews Prioritized drivers \u2022 Growth of attack surfaces \u2022 Ease of use of attack technologies \u2022 Proliferation of attack tools \u2022 Sophistication of attackers and attack tools \u2022 Increased use of digital technologies \u2022 Availability of economic opportunities in developed and developing world \u2022 Sophistication of defense professionals and \u201c white - hat hackers \u201d \u2022 Ease of use of defense tools \u2022 Sophistication of defense tools \u2022 Pace of defense technology innovation \u2022 State intervention in internet governance \u2022 International cooperation in / f_ighting cybercrime \u2022 Ability of government to enforce cybercrime laws \u2022 Facilitation of public - private , private - private information and technology sharing \u2022 Government \u2019 s ability to protect critical infrastructure \u2022 Acceptance of cyber as a tool / object of international affairs \u2022 Sophistication of government policies and regulations \u2022 Investment in education of end - users ( awareness ) \u2022 Consumer fear and con / f_idence in governments and private institutions \u2022 Growth of attack surfaces \u2022 Ease of use of attack technologies \u2022 Proliferation of attack tools \u2022 Sophistication of attackers and attack tools \u2022 Ease of use of defense tools \u2022 Pace of defense technology innovation \u2022 International cooperation in / f_ighting cybercrime \u2022 Ability of government to enforce cybercrime laws \u2022 Facilitation of public - private , private - private information and technology sharingPace of increase in intensity of threat Pace of increase in quality of response \u2022 Private institution response \u2022 Public sector response Source : Team analysis , World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company A BFI GURE 11 : TW O PR IMAR y DR IVERS I n DE FInI nG F UTURE SC EnA RIOS Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World26FI GURE 1 2 : A LTER nA TIVE FU TURE SC EnAR IOS FOR 2020 DescriptionPublic sectorPrivate institutionsPace of increase in quality of response Pace of increase in intensity of threat 1 2 3Muddling into the future Backlash decelerates digitization Cyber resilience accelerates digitizationAttackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully Attack tools proliferate leading to widespread and highly public attacks , governments react by enforcing tighter controls Defensive capabilities dramatically improve signi / f_icantly reducing fears of major cybersecurity eventsStep change Moderate increase Minimal increase Source : McKinsey & CompanyChapter 3 . Future Scenarios The range of factors shaping the cyber resilience environment is vast , as the workshop sessions found . An analysis of possible outcomes must take into account a considerable degree of uncertainty . That said , scenario planning provides various potential ways in which the environment could develop . On the future landscape of cyber resilience , the various dialogues identified dozens of shaping elements . These included such different drivers as the proliferation of attack tools , investment in educating end - users , international cooperation in fighting cybercrime , and the availability of economic opportunities in the developed and developing world . From this assortment , priority areas were distilled , and two essential drivers were defined of the future cyber resilience environment : pace of increase in the intensity of the cyber threat ; and pace of increase in the quality of response from private institutions and the public sector . ( See Figure 11 . ) A secure , robust cyber resilience environment spanning the public and private sectors would enable business and technology innovations , such as cloud computing and mobile Internet , to create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in economic value between now and the end of this decade . But if that secure environment fails to materialize because rapidly increasing cyberattacks are met with less rapidly increasing defence capabilities , a backlash against digitization could leave as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion of that value unrealized . Judging from the interviews and workshops , the executives believe that society is headed towards such a scenario , and that many components of that outcome are already beginning to materialize . From this base and other extensive workshop sessions , three alternative future scenarios for 2020 have been created . The scenarios put cyber threats in sharper relief and form an economic value model that could be either achieved or threatened by an evolving cyber resilience ecosystem ( see Figure 12 ) . The three scenarios are : - S cenario One : Muddling into the future - Sc enario Two : Backlash against digitization , prompted by p roliferating cyberattacks - Sc enario Three : Accelerated digitization thanks to robust c yber resilience 27 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldScenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization In this second scenario , the frequency and severity of attacks is significantly increased , and international cooperation in combating the proliferation of attack tools and knowledge eludes efforts to bolster defences . More attacks aim to destabilize services ( such as national payment networks ) provided by private - and public - sector institutions . Government cyber resilience regulations become increasingly directive , forcing strict industry - and country - specific compliance to complex new mandates . Governments raise barriers to cross - border flows of information and technology . Defence takes the form of siloed initiatives and limited information - sharing . Consumers become increasingly cautious , curtailing use of mobile technologies for banking and other services . Company operations under this scenario feel more exposed and restricted . As attacks escalate , cyber resilience teams increasingly deploy systems with inherent vulnerabilities , thus playing \u201c catch - up \u201d with attackers . Responses are hampered by a lack of institutional knowledge - sharing . Stringent security measures limit enterprise productivity and hinder innovation . Fears of cyber risks significantly delay the adoption of new business and technology innovations . Over time , the higher barriers to cross - border movement of information and technology hamper the efficiency of world trade and corporate resource allocation . Scenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization In this third scenario , proactive public - and private - sector action limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds institu", "validity": true}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from", "validity": true}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region . Simultaneously , the core team will proactively s", "validity": false}, {"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

As such , cyber resilience should be made part of relevant policies or systems such as a national cyber strategy , an end - to - end criminal justice system , domestic and foreign policy , and laws for the public good . nati onal strategy . Lack of national coordination can lead to redundant policy and legislation , thereby hindering economic growth and development . The Research produced certain recommendations : - E ach nation connected to the Internet should have a c omprehensive and transparent national cyber strategy t hat is integrated and harmonized with the strategies and pr ocedures across all domestic and international policy . - A s each body and organization has a role , it is crucial that t he strategies developed incorporate the private and civil s ectors , as well as leverage economic and security i ssues , among other tools , to drive the adoption of i nitiatives . The focus on incentives driven by the g overnment and independent providers should be enhanced . - F inally , a competent institution is needed to be r esponsible for the successful implementation and rollout o f the national strategy . An identifiable , responsible i nstitution will offer transparency to stakeholders in the p rocess . no t having a resource to consult often leads to c hallenges of ownership , function and action , the r esearch highlighted . End - to - end criminal justice system . \u201c Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless , \u201d a chief information officer ( CIO ) observes in an interview . Indeed , law enforcement needs to have the capability and resources to investigate cybercrimes and to have an appropriate , comprehensive and agile legal code to support its investigative and prosecutorial activities . Cyber resilience is a complex matter that may not be entirely clear to everybody in the criminal justice system . As such , it is critical that legal advocates , either through further education or other training , understand the cyber resilience ecosystem well enough to carry out due process . Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless . Chief information officer of a financial services organisationDomestic policy . no clear consensus emerged in the F orum - McKinsey workshops and dialogues on the nature of public - sector action needed domestically . Based on the background and regulatory history of the participants , it seemed that different sectors had different views on the most beneficial action . As such , two key points are identified : - pr ivate , public and civil dialogue is needed to develop a c oherent mix of policy and market mechanisms for u se in the cyber ecosystem . no t taking a m ultistakeholder approach risks eliciting a mix of r esponses that could be weighted unevenly in one area , r esulting in limited success . - A rapidly changing cyber resilience landscape r equires all government mechanisms to support the e fforts of law enforcement and to be appropriately agile . It was emphasized during a December 2013 r oundtable discussion of partners in Washington DC that a major impediment to potential public - sector actions w ould be a rigid set of codes that did not allow changes t o a highly dynamic sector . Foreign policy . \u201c Cyberattacks have the potential to change the nature of warfare and international relations , almost past the level of the Cold War , \u201d says the CIO of a European aerospace and defence company . It is clear that cyber events are changing the nature of interstate relations . As such , countries should establish a national cyber doctrine to define and express their positions on the use of cyber resilience tools and weapons for national purposes . The workshops and dialogues showed that today different organizations are sharing information and cooperating on cyber actions . Communication , formal and informal , is essential among those investigating , prosecuting and enforcing laws on cybercrime . Making the process transparent can help to cut the confusion and lag in tracking and prosecution . In addition , each level of government is responsible for identifying competent authorities and for creating interoperability among national entities and sovereign legal codes . For businesses to continue to expand , better harmonization of national policies will be needed . All these requirements reiterate the need for a multistakeholder approach to address cyber risks . A primary concern voiced by several institutions is the often - stark differences in requirements for different nations . This challenge can drastically affect the growth of international and local businesses . pub lic good . For the public good , all stakeholders need to ensure that they contribute to and maintain an evolving and robust incident - response capability . This ranges from established programs for information - sharing and incident response such as CERT ( Computer Emergency Readiness Team ) to information training and development of human resources . Such a dynamic space demands an ever - evolving set of capabilities to match the changing pace of the threat . Maintenance includes possible funding for cyber resilience research and greater investment in cyber resilience technical education in order to foster a more cyber - aware workforce . FIGURE 1 : POTE nTIAL ACTIO nS TO IMPROVE InSTITUTIO nAL READI nESS Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World103 . Community Responses In cyber resilience components where public and private interests intersect , it is vital for the community to agree and act as one . This is particularly important for infrastructure , which often accommodates many interests . The community can cooperate on actions such as : research , information - sharing , knowledge transfer , self - governance , sharing resources for capability building , and mutual aid . Research . Cyber resilience or cybersecurity is still a fairly nascent topic , and requires further investment from interested parties to be fully understood and developed . As such , it is important to encourage public - and private - sector efforts to better understand the impact of cyber resilience on enterprises , nations and macroeconomics . This common language development would be helpful in setting priorities and focusing government policies on cyber resilience . Many advancements in this space occurred outside formal institutions . As such , it will be important to create an atmosphere in which counter - attack ( \u201c white - hat hacker \u201d ) research is not only encouraged but also supported financially . Shared resource for capability building . Foster partnerships among governments , universities and the private sector to develop skills in this area . Information - sharing . As one of the core areas of focus identified by the Partnership for Cyber Resilience in 2012 , key recommendations surfaced regarding sharing of information : - W here legally feasible , institutions need to find m echanisms for information - sharing already in existence , e ither formally or informally . - T owards that end , it will be critical to improve the quality of t he ISACs / CERTs / CIERTs and other information - sharing v enues to provide the best variety of options . - T he success of such programs requires the promotion of a n interoperable , extensible and automated system for s haring information . 4 . Systemic Responses A series of actions can greatly improve the quality of conversation on cyber resilience and accelerate coordination . Although thinking on this issue continues to evolve , two areas offer promise in building maturity in the ecosystem : - R isk markets . Making use of a developed cyber risk i nsurance market to trade and monetize the risk from c yber events . - E mbedded security . Exploring options to embed s ecurity parameters earlier into the lifecycle of products , a nd even into contemporary means of communication , s uch as the Internet . Against this backdrop of high - value responses , it is worth noting that another range of actions is likely to deliver low or uncertain value in fostering cyber resilience . For example , while governments may be in a position to disrupt supply chains for attack vectors , such a move by private - sector institutions would seem to be uncertain or counter - productive because of the collateral fallout . For their part , regulators may be able to engage in counter - attacks and service disruptions , but they should be cautious about allowing Internet service providers to engage in similar efforts because of possible reprisals on the overall infrastructure or bystander organizations .11 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness Cyber resilience is becoming a critical business and social issue . As more and more business value and personal information rapidly migrates to digital form , the risks from cyberattacks grow ever more daunting . On the front line are public and private institutions that rely on cyber resilience systems and controls to protect intellectual property , information assets and business continuity . Supporting them are regulators who develop the policies to facilitate and defend technology , law enforcement agencies , and industry associations that work to share information and improve institutional security . Defying all of them are cyberattackers , with a wide range of motives and sophisticated tools to access or disrupt cyber services . Criminals pursue financial gain through online fraud or theft of identity . State - sponsored actors engage in online espionage and sabotage . Competitors steal intellectual property or interrupt business to grab advantage . Online \u201c hactivists \u201d pierce firewalls to disturb functions or make political statements . Often , insiders help the external attackers or initiate their own attacks , worsening the odds for institutions . Eliminating threats from sophisticated malevolent players is impossible . Other factors also complicate the response . Open and interconnected technology environments make historic \u201c protect the perimeter \u201d strategies insufficient and , in many cases , counter - productive . As mentioned earlier , much of the damage is caused by inadequate response to the breach , rather than the breach itself . Moreover , mitigating the impact of attacks and ruptures often implies complicated trade - offs between risk reduction and business impact . Large institutions struggle with cyber resilience decisions because quantifying risks and its alleviation is difficult , and getting executive engagement on trade - offs is practically impossible . Cyber resilience is the successful mitigation of the strategic and economic impacts of cyberattacks , and is based on cybersecurity capabilities . This chapter assesses the options for participants in the security ecosystem to increase cyber resilience . These findings are gleaned from the workshops held over 2013 and the interviews with more than 200 industry leaders in seven sectors across the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa , and Asia . 2 The workshops and interviews focused on three topics : practitioner views on the importance of cyber risks ; the impact of attacks on businesses , the effect of cyber risks on investment in research and development ( R & D ) and efforts to mitigate risk ; and potential mitigating actions . The interviews were augmented with survey data that compared cyber resilience capability in large firms with best practices across multiple sectors and regions . Some critical findings from the research include : 1 . For most companies across sectors and regions , cyber resilience is a strategic risk The workshop and interview sessions found that European companies are slightly more concerned than their American counterparts about cyber resilience . The research also indicated that as awareness has grown , chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief technology officers ( CTOs ) are just as concerned as chief Information security officer ( CISOs ) . Practitioners believe cyberattacks are a greater risk than other types of technology risks . Some executives found internal threats to be as big a risk as external attacks ( see Figure 2 ) . Financial institutions are particularly sensitive \u2014 about 80 % of them believe cyber resilience is a \u201c strategic risk \u201d , compared with roughly half of other institutions . \u201c The issue is coming earlier in the conversation , \u201d says the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of a high - tech vendor . \u201c Before , we may not have covered it until the end of the meeting ; now it is the first or second thing companies are asking us about . \u201d ( See Figure 3 . ) The nature of the threat is heavily dependent on sector . \u201c Product \u201d companies , such as those in high technology , are most concerned about industrial espionage . \u201c Services \u201d companies focus on the loss and release of personally identifiable information and service disruption . Concern also exists over interference with business operations over time . For product companies , the leaking of proprietary knowledge about production processes may be more damaging than leaks of product specifications , given the pervasiveness of \u201c tear down \u201d techniques and legal protection for product designs .

The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from", "validity": false}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": true}]}, {"sentence": "\n\nThe report proposes a framework for collaboration and a roadmap for action, highlighting the need for institutional readiness, public and international policy, community action, and systemic action", "sentence_context_matches": [{"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": false}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue .

Relationships between private and public institutions are unformed in many cases . Consensus is limited across industries , and across the private and public sectors . Insurance executives indicate that individual companies and institutions may have the strongest impact in fending off cyber risks . Respondents from the high - tech sector and from the largest corporations \u2013 those with a market cap of more than US $ 50 billion \u2013 indicate that technology vendors may be in a position to have the strongest impact . Similarly , the perception of regulation varies widely , depending on sector . Consensus is lacking on which public - sector actions would be most beneficial . Executives worry that broad agreement regulations can lock in outdated techniques , and that regulators lack the skills and capabilities to provide effective input . Financial - services technology executives say that regulation is actively harmful because it forces a focus on the wrong things . ye t a large proportion of respondents from the healthcare and insurance sectors view regulations as helpful in managing cyber resilience . Healthcare technology executives say regulation is not ideal but remains valuable because it compels senior management to commit attention and resources to security issues . \u201c Institutionally , we can take all the actions we want but the threat will only be reduced when governments and law enforcement agencies are able to take action , \u201d says the CISO of a pharmaceutical company . ( See Figure 10 . ) Traditional approaches also appear increasingly ineffective . In most cases businesses rely mainly on passive measures , typically addressing issues only after they have arisen . Business partners are not sufficiently involved , and policing and application of cyber resilience lack consistent rigour . Responses are often backward looking , require specialized talent that is costly and hard to find , and rely mostly on technology solutions , even though sophisticated agents often attack the weakest link : customers and employees . Still , the research finds near universal agreement among CSOs , CTOs and CISOs that a step - change improvement is needed in their own capabilities to protect their businesses from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats , enable productivity and innovation , and maintain a competitive cost position . Says the CISO of a global bank : \u201c yo u have some at the top and some that are clueless , but the bulk are in the middle and they are behind \u201d ( i . e . below the median ) . Adds the cyber resilience chief of a national law enforcement agency : \u201c Some businesses have really improved their position , but more need to take [ cyber resilience ] as a business issue overall and really need to improve their resilience . \u201d Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 2223 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 10 : IMP ACT OF C yBE R R ESILIE nC E Interview question : What impact does government regulation have on your ability to manage cybersecurity related risks ? % of respondents Banking Healthcare Insurance High - techResponses by sector 63 9 45 19 32 37 45 36 44 40 0 18 18 25 1612 13 0 27 0Aggregate responses 1 2 3 4No / Limited impact On balance it encourages us to be more secure in a helpful way It requires a lot of time and effort , but does not really make us more secure It makes us less secure by requiring actions that do not make sense or taking resources away from higher priority actionsMost frequent response Source : Industry leader interviews ; team analysis , World Economic Forum and McKinsey & CompanyLarge proportion of respondents from healthcare and insurance sectors view regulations as helpful in managing cybersecurityRisk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World24 SC EnA RI oS TESTI nG AT THE Ann U AL ME ETInG oF THE nEW CH AMpIo nS D uring the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of ne w Champions 2013 in Dalian , People \u2019 s Republic of China , senior business leaders and executives convened at a private session to explore current and future potential drivers and trends that will define the cyber ecosystem .

Future Scenarios The range of factors shaping the cyber resilience environment is vast , as the workshop sessions found . An analysis of possible outcomes must take into account a considerable degree of uncertainty . That said , scenario planning provides various potential ways in which the environment could develop . On the future landscape of cyber resilience , the various dialogues identified dozens of shaping elements . These included such different drivers as the proliferation of attack tools , investment in educating end - users , international cooperation in fighting cybercrime , and the availability of economic opportunities in the developed and developing world . From this assortment , priority areas were distilled , and two essential drivers were defined of the future cyber resilience environment : pace of increase in the intensity of the cyber threat ; and pace of increase in the quality of response from private institutions and the public sector . ( See Figure 11 . ) A secure , robust cyber resilience environment spanning the public and private sectors would enable business and technology innovations , such as cloud computing and mobile Internet , to create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in economic value between now and the end of this decade . But if that secure environment fails to materialize because rapidly increasing cyberattacks are met with less rapidly increasing defence capabilities , a backlash against digitization could leave as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion of that value unrealized . Judging from the interviews and workshops , the executives believe that society is headed towards such a scenario , and that many components of that outcome are already beginning to materialize . From this base and other extensive workshop sessions , three alternative future scenarios for 2020 have been created . The scenarios put cyber threats in sharper relief and form an economic value model that could be either achieved or threatened by an evolving cyber resilience ecosystem ( see Figure 12 ) . The three scenarios are : - S cenario One : Muddling into the future - Sc enario Two : Backlash against digitization , prompted by p roliferating cyberattacks - Sc enario Three : Accelerated digitization thanks to robust c yber resilience 27 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldScenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization In this second scenario , the frequency and severity of attacks is significantly increased , and international cooperation in combating the proliferation of attack tools and knowledge eludes efforts to bolster defences . More attacks aim to destabilize services ( such as national payment networks ) provided by private - and public - sector institutions . Government cyber resilience regulations become increasingly directive , forcing strict industry - and country - specific compliance to complex new mandates . Governments raise barriers to cross - border flows of information and technology . Defence takes the form of siloed initiatives and limited information - sharing . Consumers become increasingly cautious , curtailing use of mobile technologies for banking and other services . Company operations under this scenario feel more exposed and restricted . As attacks escalate , cyber resilience teams increasingly deploy systems with inherent vulnerabilities , thus playing \u201c catch - up \u201d with attackers . Responses are hampered by a lack of institutional knowledge - sharing . Stringent security measures limit enterprise productivity and hinder innovation . Fears of cyber risks significantly delay the adoption of new business and technology innovations . Over time , the higher barriers to cross - border movement of information and technology hamper the efficiency of world trade and corporate resource allocation .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from", "validity": false}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": false}]}]}]}, {"model_metrics_list": [{"summary_model_name": "meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct", "summary_prompt_template": "\n    Write a concise summary of the following text delimited by triple backquotes.\n\n    ```$text```\n\n    CONCISE SUMMARY:", "document_title": "7.pdf", "summary": "\n\nThe World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company report \"Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World\" highlights the need for a robust, coordinated system of global cyber resilience to mitigate the growing concern of cyberattacks.

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another .

The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies .

Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from", "validity": true}, {"context": "tional capabilities , and stimulates innovation and economic efficiency . Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region . Simultaneously , the core team will proactively s", "validity": true}, {"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

As such , cyber resilience should be made part of relevant policies or systems such as a national cyber strategy , an end - to - end criminal justice system , domestic and foreign policy , and laws for the public good . nati onal strategy . Lack of national coordination can lead to redundant policy and legislation , thereby hindering economic growth and development . The Research produced certain recommendations : - E ach nation connected to the Internet should have a c omprehensive and transparent national cyber strategy t hat is integrated and harmonized with the strategies and pr ocedures across all domestic and international policy . - A s each body and organization has a role , it is crucial that t he strategies developed incorporate the private and civil s ectors , as well as leverage economic and security i ssues , among other tools , to drive the adoption of i nitiatives . The focus on incentives driven by the g overnment and independent providers should be enhanced . - F inally , a competent institution is needed to be r esponsible for the successful implementation and rollout o f the national strategy . An identifiable , responsible i nstitution will offer transparency to stakeholders in the p rocess . no t having a resource to consult often leads to c hallenges of ownership , function and action , the r esearch highlighted . End - to - end criminal justice system . \u201c Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless , \u201d a chief information officer ( CIO ) observes in an interview . Indeed , law enforcement needs to have the capability and resources to investigate cybercrimes and to have an appropriate , comprehensive and agile legal code to support its investigative and prosecutorial activities . Cyber resilience is a complex matter that may not be entirely clear to everybody in the criminal justice system . As such , it is critical that legal advocates , either through further education or other training , understand the cyber resilience ecosystem well enough to carry out due process . Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless . Chief information officer of a financial services organisationDomestic policy . no clear consensus emerged in the F orum - McKinsey workshops and dialogues on the nature of public - sector action needed domestically . Based on the background and regulatory history of the participants , it seemed that different sectors had different views on the most beneficial action . As such , two key points are identified : - pr ivate , public and civil dialogue is needed to develop a c oherent mix of policy and market mechanisms for u se in the cyber ecosystem . no t taking a m ultistakeholder approach risks eliciting a mix of r esponses that could be weighted unevenly in one area , r esulting in limited success . - A rapidly changing cyber resilience landscape r equires all government mechanisms to support the e fforts of law enforcement and to be appropriately agile . It was emphasized during a December 2013 r oundtable discussion of partners in Washington DC that a major impediment to potential public - sector actions w ould be a rigid set of codes that did not allow changes t o a highly dynamic sector . Foreign policy . \u201c Cyberattacks have the potential to change the nature of warfare and international relations , almost past the level of the Cold War , \u201d says the CIO of a European aerospace and defence company . It is clear that cyber events are changing the nature of interstate relations . As such , countries should establish a national cyber doctrine to define and express their positions on the use of cyber resilience tools and weapons for national purposes . The workshops and dialogues showed that today different organizations are sharing information and cooperating on cyber actions . Communication , formal and informal , is essential among those investigating , prosecuting and enforcing laws on cybercrime . Making the process transparent can help to cut the confusion and lag in tracking and prosecution . In addition , each level of government is responsible for identifying competent authorities and for creating interoperability among national entities and sovereign legal codes . For businesses to continue to expand , better harmonization of national policies will be needed . All these requirements reiterate the need for a multistakeholder approach to address cyber risks . A primary concern voiced by several institutions is the often - stark differences in requirements for different nations . This challenge can drastically affect the growth of international and local businesses . pub lic good . For the public good , all stakeholders need to ensure that they contribute to and maintain an evolving and robust incident - response capability . This ranges from established programs for information - sharing and incident response such as CERT ( Computer Emergency Readiness Team ) to information training and development of human resources . Such a dynamic space demands an ever - evolving set of capabilities to match the changing pace of the threat . Maintenance includes possible funding for cyber resilience research and greater investment in cyber resilience technical education in order to foster a more cyber - aware workforce . FIGURE 1 : POTE nTIAL ACTIO nS TO IMPROVE InSTITUTIO nAL READI nESS Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World103 . Community Responses In cyber resilience components where public and private interests intersect , it is vital for the community to agree and act as one . This is particularly important for infrastructure , which often accommodates many interests . The community can cooperate on actions such as : research , information - sharing , knowledge transfer , self - governance , sharing resources for capability building , and mutual aid . Research . Cyber resilience or cybersecurity is still a fairly nascent topic , and requires further investment from interested parties to be fully understood and developed . As such , it is important to encourage public - and private - sector efforts to better understand the impact of cyber resilience on enterprises , nations and macroeconomics . This common language development would be helpful in setting priorities and focusing government policies on cyber resilience . Many advancements in this space occurred outside formal institutions . As such , it will be important to create an atmosphere in which counter - attack ( \u201c white - hat hacker \u201d ) research is not only encouraged but also supported financially . Shared resource for capability building . Foster partnerships among governments , universities and the private sector to develop skills in this area . Information - sharing . As one of the core areas of focus identified by the Partnership for Cyber Resilience in 2012 , key recommendations surfaced regarding sharing of information : - W here legally feasible , institutions need to find m echanisms for information - sharing already in existence , e ither formally or informally . - T owards that end , it will be critical to improve the quality of t he ISACs / CERTs / CIERTs and other information - sharing v enues to provide the best variety of options . - T he success of such programs requires the promotion of a n interoperable , extensible and automated system for s haring information . 4 . Systemic Responses A series of actions can greatly improve the quality of conversation on cyber resilience and accelerate coordination . Although thinking on this issue continues to evolve , two areas offer promise in building maturity in the ecosystem : - R isk markets . Making use of a developed cyber risk i nsurance market to trade and monetize the risk from c yber events . - E mbedded security . Exploring options to embed s ecurity parameters earlier into the lifecycle of products , a nd even into contemporary means of communication , s uch as the Internet . Against this backdrop of high - value responses , it is worth noting that another range of actions is likely to deliver low or uncertain value in fostering cyber resilience . For example , while governments may be in a position to disrupt supply chains for attack vectors , such a move by private - sector institutions would seem to be uncertain or counter - productive because of the collateral fallout . For their part , regulators may be able to engage in counter - attacks and service disruptions , but they should be cautious about allowing Internet service providers to engage in similar efforts because of possible reprisals on the overall infrastructure or bystander organizations .11 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness Cyber resilience is becoming a critical business and social issue . As more and more business value and personal information rapidly migrates to digital form , the risks from cyberattacks grow ever more daunting . On the front line are public and private institutions that rely on cyber resilience systems and controls to protect intellectual property , information assets and business continuity . Supporting them are regulators who develop the policies to facilitate and defend technology , law enforcement agencies , and industry associations that work to share information and improve institutional security . Defying all of them are cyberattackers , with a wide range of motives and sophisticated tools to access or disrupt cyber services . Criminals pursue financial gain through online fraud or theft of identity . State - sponsored actors engage in online espionage and sabotage . Competitors steal intellectual property or interrupt business to grab advantage . Online \u201c hactivists \u201d pierce firewalls to disturb functions or make political statements . Often , insiders help the external attackers or initiate their own attacks , worsening the odds for institutions . Eliminating threats from sophisticated malevolent players is impossible . Other factors also complicate the response . Open and interconnected technology environments make historic \u201c protect the perimeter \u201d strategies insufficient and , in many cases , counter - productive . As mentioned earlier , much of the damage is caused by inadequate response to the breach , rather than the breach itself . Moreover , mitigating the impact of attacks and ruptures often implies complicated trade - offs between risk reduction and business impact . Large institutions struggle with cyber resilience decisions because quantifying risks and its alleviation is difficult , and getting executive engagement on trade - offs is practically impossible . Cyber resilience is the successful mitigation of the strategic and economic impacts of cyberattacks , and is based on cybersecurity capabilities . This chapter assesses the options for participants in the security ecosystem to increase cyber resilience . These findings are gleaned from the workshops held over 2013 and the interviews with more than 200 industry leaders in seven sectors across the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa , and Asia . 2 The workshops and interviews focused on three topics : practitioner views on the importance of cyber risks ; the impact of attacks on businesses , the effect of cyber risks on investment in research and development ( R & D ) and efforts to mitigate risk ; and potential mitigating actions . The interviews were augmented with survey data that compared cyber resilience capability in large firms with best practices across multiple sectors and regions . Some critical findings from the research include : 1 . For most companies across sectors and regions , cyber resilience is a strategic risk The workshop and interview sessions found that European companies are slightly more concerned than their American counterparts about cyber resilience . The research also indicated that as awareness has grown , chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief technology officers ( CTOs ) are just as concerned as chief Information security officer ( CISOs ) . Practitioners believe cyberattacks are a greater risk than other types of technology risks . Some executives found internal threats to be as big a risk as external attacks ( see Figure 2 ) . Financial institutions are particularly sensitive \u2014 about 80 % of them believe cyber resilience is a \u201c strategic risk \u201d , compared with roughly half of other institutions . \u201c The issue is coming earlier in the conversation , \u201d says the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of a high - tech vendor . \u201c Before , we may not have covered it until the end of the meeting ; now it is the first or second thing companies are asking us about . \u201d ( See Figure 3 . ) The nature of the threat is heavily dependent on sector . \u201c Product \u201d companies , such as those in high technology , are most concerned about industrial espionage . \u201c Services \u201d companies focus on the loss and release of personally identifiable information and service disruption . Concern also exists over interference with business operations over time . For product companies , the leaking of proprietary knowledge about production processes may be more damaging than leaks of product specifications , given the pervasiveness of \u201c tear down \u201d techniques and legal protection for product designs .

Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental .

Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": false}]}, {"sentence": " It identifies three key areas for action: institutional readiness, public and international policy, and community action", "sentence_context_matches": [{"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas As the risk of cyberattacks is becoming more prevalent , the cost of the attacks \u2013 to companies , public institutions , the global economy and society at large \u2013 is also growing . This is the clear message that emerged from research assembled over the past year . To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": false}, {"context": "Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World In collaboration with McKinsey & CompanyInsight Report January 2014 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World2Contents Executive Summary 2 E xecutive Summary 5 I ntroduction Chapter 1 .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable . Designed in a pre - digital world , they move too slowly and ignore the digital age \u2019 s interdependencies . Indeed , in many cases , even the underlying values and concepts cannot be depended upon \u2013 the digital era has re - constituted ideas such as privacy , ownership and security . The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event . This notion of security seems quaint in a world where it is impossible to draw a clean ring around the network of one country or one company , and where large organizations can be the target of 10 , 000 cyberattacks per day . 3 . Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue .

As such , cyber resilience should be made part of relevant policies or systems such as a national cyber strategy , an end - to - end criminal justice system , domestic and foreign policy , and laws for the public good . nati onal strategy . Lack of national coordination can lead to redundant policy and legislation , thereby hindering economic growth and development . The Research produced certain recommendations : - E ach nation connected to the Internet should have a c omprehensive and transparent national cyber strategy t hat is integrated and harmonized with the strategies and pr ocedures across all domestic and international policy . - A s each body and organization has a role , it is crucial that t he strategies developed incorporate the private and civil s ectors , as well as leverage economic and security i ssues , among other tools , to drive the adoption of i nitiatives . The focus on incentives driven by the g overnment and independent providers should be enhanced . - F inally , a competent institution is needed to be r esponsible for the successful implementation and rollout o f the national strategy . An identifiable , responsible i nstitution will offer transparency to stakeholders in the p rocess . no t having a resource to consult often leads to c hallenges of ownership , function and action , the r esearch highlighted . End - to - end criminal justice system . \u201c Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless , \u201d a chief information officer ( CIO ) observes in an interview . Indeed , law enforcement needs to have the capability and resources to investigate cybercrimes and to have an appropriate , comprehensive and agile legal code to support its investigative and prosecutorial activities . Cyber resilience is a complex matter that may not be entirely clear to everybody in the criminal justice system . As such , it is critical that legal advocates , either through further education or other training , understand the cyber resilience ecosystem well enough to carry out due process . Institutions can take all the actions they want on their own . However , if there is no law - enforcement mechanism to pursue and prosecute perpetrators , then our actions are meaningless . Chief information officer of a financial services organisationDomestic policy . no clear consensus emerged in the F orum - McKinsey workshops and dialogues on the nature of public - sector action needed domestically . Based on the background and regulatory history of the participants , it seemed that different sectors had different views on the most beneficial action . As such , two key points are identified : - pr ivate , public and civil dialogue is needed to develop a c oherent mix of policy and market mechanisms for u se in the cyber ecosystem . no t taking a m ultistakeholder approach risks eliciting a mix of r esponses that could be weighted unevenly in one area , r esulting in limited success . - A rapidly changing cyber resilience landscape r equires all government mechanisms to support the e fforts of law enforcement and to be appropriately agile . It was emphasized during a December 2013 r oundtable discussion of partners in Washington DC that a major impediment to potential public - sector actions w ould be a rigid set of codes that did not allow changes t o a highly dynamic sector . Foreign policy . \u201c Cyberattacks have the potential to change the nature of warfare and international relations , almost past the level of the Cold War , \u201d says the CIO of a European aerospace and defence company . It is clear that cyber events are changing the nature of interstate relations . As such , countries should establish a national cyber doctrine to define and express their positions on the use of cyber resilience tools and weapons for national purposes . The workshops and dialogues showed that today different organizations are sharing information and cooperating on cyber actions . Communication , formal and informal , is essential among those investigating , prosecuting and enforcing laws on cybercrime . Making the process transparent can help to cut the confusion and lag in tracking and prosecution . In addition , each level of government is responsible for identifying competent authorities and for creating interoperability among national entities and sovereign legal codes . For businesses to continue to expand , better harmonization of national policies will be needed . All these requirements reiterate the need for a multistakeholder approach to address cyber risks . A primary concern voiced by several institutions is the often - stark differences in requirements for different nations . This challenge can drastically affect the growth of international and local businesses . pub lic good . For the public good , all stakeholders need to ensure that they contribute to and maintain an evolving and robust incident - response capability . This ranges from established programs for information - sharing and incident response such as CERT ( Computer Emergency Readiness Team ) to information training and development of human resources . Such a dynamic space demands an ever - evolving set of capabilities to match the changing pace of the threat . Maintenance includes possible funding for cyber resilience research and greater investment in cyber resilience technical education in order to foster a more cyber - aware workforce . FIGURE 1 : POTE nTIAL ACTIO nS TO IMPROVE InSTITUTIO nAL READI nESS Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World103 . Community Responses In cyber resilience components where public and private interests intersect , it is vital for the community to agree and act as one . This is particularly important for infrastructure , which often accommodates many interests . The community can cooperate on actions such as : research , information - sharing , knowledge transfer , self - governance , sharing resources for capability building , and mutual aid . Research . Cyber resilience or cybersecurity is still a fairly nascent topic , and requires further investment from interested parties to be fully understood and developed . As such , it is important to encourage public - and private - sector efforts to better understand the impact of cyber resilience on enterprises , nations and macroeconomics . This common language development would be helpful in setting priorities and focusing government policies on cyber resilience . Many advancements in this space occurred outside formal institutions . As such , it will be important to create an atmosphere in which counter - attack ( \u201c white - hat hacker \u201d ) research is not only encouraged but also supported financially . Shared resource for capability building . Foster partnerships among governments , universities and the private sector to develop skills in this area . Information - sharing . As one of the core areas of focus identified by the Partnership for Cyber Resilience in 2012 , key recommendations surfaced regarding sharing of information : - W here legally feasible , institutions need to find m echanisms for information - sharing already in existence , e ither formally or informally . - T owards that end , it will be critical to improve the quality of t he ISACs / CERTs / CIERTs and other information - sharing v enues to provide the best variety of options . - T he success of such programs requires the promotion of a n interoperable , extensible and automated system for s haring information . 4 . Systemic Responses A series of actions can greatly improve the quality of conversation on cyber resilience and accelerate coordination . Although thinking on this issue continues to evolve , two areas offer promise in building maturity in the ecosystem : - R isk markets . Making use of a developed cyber risk i nsurance market to trade and monetize the risk from c yber events . - E mbedded security . Exploring options to embed s ecurity parameters earlier into the lifecycle of products , a nd even into contemporary means of communication , s uch as the Internet . Against this backdrop of high - value responses , it is worth noting that another range of actions is likely to deliver low or uncertain value in fostering cyber resilience . For example , while governments may be in a position to disrupt supply chains for attack vectors , such a move by private - sector institutions would seem to be uncertain or counter - productive because of the collateral fallout . For their part , regulators may be able to engage in counter - attacks and service disruptions , but they should be cautious about allowing Internet service providers to engage in similar efforts because of possible reprisals on the overall infrastructure or bystander organizations .11 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness Cyber resilience is becoming a critical business and social issue . As more and more business value and personal information rapidly migrates to digital form , the risks from cyberattacks grow ever more daunting . On the front line are public and private institutions that rely on cyber resilience systems and controls to protect intellectual property , information assets and business continuity . Supporting them are regulators who develop the policies to facilitate and defend technology , law enforcement agencies , and industry associations that work to share information and improve institutional security . Defying all of them are cyberattackers , with a wide range of motives and sophisticated tools to access or disrupt cyber services . Criminals pursue financial gain through online fraud or theft of identity . State - sponsored actors engage in online espionage and sabotage . Competitors steal intellectual property or interrupt business to grab advantage . Online \u201c hactivists \u201d pierce firewalls to disturb functions or make political statements . Often , insiders help the external attackers or initiate their own attacks , worsening the odds for institutions . Eliminating threats from sophisticated malevolent players is impossible . Other factors also complicate the response . Open and interconnected technology environments make historic \u201c protect the perimeter \u201d strategies insufficient and , in many cases , counter - productive . As mentioned earlier , much of the damage is caused by inadequate response to the breach , rather than the breach itself . Moreover , mitigating the impact of attacks and ruptures often implies complicated trade - offs between risk reduction and business impact . Large institutions struggle with cyber resilience decisions because quantifying risks and its alleviation is difficult , and getting executive engagement on trade - offs is practically impossible . Cyber resilience is the successful mitigation of the strategic and economic impacts of cyberattacks , and is based on cybersecurity capabilities . This chapter assesses the options for participants in the security ecosystem to increase cyber resilience . These findings are gleaned from the workshops held over 2013 and the interviews with more than 200 industry leaders in seven sectors across the Americas , Europe , the Middle East and Africa , and Asia . 2 The workshops and interviews focused on three topics : practitioner views on the importance of cyber risks ; the impact of attacks on businesses , the effect of cyber risks on investment in research and development ( R & D ) and efforts to mitigate risk ; and potential mitigating actions . The interviews were augmented with survey data that compared cyber resilience capability in large firms with best practices across multiple sectors and regions . Some critical findings from the research include : 1 . For most companies across sectors and regions , cyber resilience is a strategic risk The workshop and interview sessions found that European companies are slightly more concerned than their American counterparts about cyber resilience . The research also indicated that as awareness has grown , chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief technology officers ( CTOs ) are just as concerned as chief Information security officer ( CISOs ) . Practitioners believe cyberattacks are a greater risk than other types of technology risks . Some executives found internal threats to be as big a risk as external attacks ( see Figure 2 ) . Financial institutions are particularly sensitive \u2014 about 80 % of them believe cyber resilience is a \u201c strategic risk \u201d , compared with roughly half of other institutions . \u201c The issue is coming earlier in the conversation , \u201d says the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of a high - tech vendor . \u201c Before , we may not have covered it until the end of the meeting ; now it is the first or second thing companies are asking us about . \u201d ( See Figure 3 . ) The nature of the threat is heavily dependent on sector . \u201c Product \u201d companies , such as those in high technology , are most concerned about industrial espionage . \u201c Services \u201d companies focus on the loss and release of personally identifiable information and service disruption . Concern also exists over interference with business operations over time . For product companies , the leaking of proprietary knowledge about production processes may be more damaging than leaks of product specifications , given the pervasiveness of \u201c tear down \u201d techniques and legal protection for product designs .

Formalized national cyber resilience legislation is paired with international collaboration to investigate and prosecute cyberattacks . International government coordination strengthens trust among individual institutions , allowing the establishment of stronger standards , greater cross - border collaboration and information exchange . International bodies emerge to coordinate the battle against cyber threats , leading to a more integrated global defence . Institutional capabilities grow , information exchange increases , and the adoption of innovative technologies accelerates . This scenario offers a vital cyber resilience ecosystem that enables and connects company operations . Senior executives and company boards tap into expanding collaboration between public and private entities . Cyber resilience becomes more important on the C - suite agenda , and executives actively engage with CISOs on the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience , such as entry into new markets or outsourcing agreements . More sophisticated cyber resilience practices and technologies allow institutions to contain emerging threats . Enhanced defences against cyber breaches permit companies to connect more effectively with customers . Companies and consumers adopt innovations more quickly and freely . Information moves more easily across borders , enhancing the efficiency of trade and resource allocation . Applying the Scenarios The output of the research and extensive partner workshops builds upon the work of the McKinsey Global Institute ( see box ) and other earlier efforts . It applies the three scenarios , estimating for each the economic value to be realized or lost as cyber resilience readiness affects adoption of business and technology innovations . Overall , it is estimated that these technologies represent between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in potential value creation by 2020 . ye t even in the baseline scenario , in which the intensity and pace of cyberattacks increase only incrementally , the executives interviewed expect significant delays in implementing many of the most valuable business and technology innovations . ( See Figure 13 . ) In 2012 the McKinsey Global Institute set out to identify the technologies that over the next decade would truly matter to business leaders as they planned strategies , and to policy - makers as they tried to understand how technology would shape the global economy and society . The research focused on the speed , scope and economic value at stake from a dozen economically disruptive technologies \u2014 among them , cloud technology , the mobile Internet , and the networks of low - cost sensors and data collection and monitoring , commonly referred to as the \u201c Internet of Things . \u201d MGI Disruptive Technologies report 2012Calculated across the full range of some of these innovations , the risk of delays to adoption due to cyber threats could carry a high price tag for the global economy . In the scenario in which private and public institutions \u201c muddle \u201d into the future , the shortfall in estimated value created by 2020 could reach as high as US $ 1 trillion . And in the scenario where the private - and public - sector response to cyberattacks prompts a backlash against digitization , the impact on the global economy could amount to as much as US $ 3 . 06 trillion in unrealized value creation , or 14 % of the total potential value creation of those technologies . ( See Figure 14 . ) Scenario One : Muddling into the Future In this baseline scenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders who continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit successfully . The level of threat rises incrementally , and a greater sophistication of attack tools consistently leaves defenders trailing . Institutions implement more stringent controls , but government intervention remains fragmented . no powerful international bodies emerge to coordinate the fight against cyber threats through the sharing of information and knowledge on attacker locations , intentions and strategies . Few cross - industry associations are effective in facilitating such exchanges . At the operating level in this scenario , most business decisions likely are made without factoring in cyber resilience . Leaders continue to lack a clear grasp of the magnitude and nature of cyber threats . Senior business executives and company boards rarely engage with CISOs to consider the implications of business decisions on cyber resilience . Fragmented security solutions create operational inefficiencies such as slower transaction times . On the one hand , the potential advancement of new cyber defence technologies could hold out the opportunity for improved future security . On the other hand , fears of cyber resilience risks stemming from new business and technology innovations likely significantly delays adoption of those technologies , perhaps slowing global economic growth .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World28FI GURE 13 : P O TEn TIAL IM PACT OF CyB ERSECURIT y RI SKS TO G LOBAL EC OnOMy 1Estimated does not include consumer surplus Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Impacted by cybersecurity risks Total value : $ 9 , 630 \u2013 21 , 630BBusiness & technology innovationsDescription Estimated value created by 2020USD BillionEstimated delay by intervieweesMonths Use of computer hardware and software resources delivered over a network or the internet , often as a serviceCloud technology Networks of low - cost sensors and actuators for data collection , monitoring decision - making , and process optimizationInternet of things Increasingly inexpensive and capable mobile computing devices and internet connectivityMobile internet Technologically enabled entrance into new geographies Intelligent software systems that can perform knowledge work tasks involving unstructured commands and subtle judgements Social networks , commerce , shared workspaces , media and / f_ile sharing , crowd - sourcing , social gamingSocial technologies Buying and selling of goods and services over the InternetE - commerce 1 Vehicles that can navigate and operate with reduced or no human intervention Fast , low - cost gene sequencing , advanced big data analytics , and synthetic biology ( \u201c writing \u201d DNA ) Increasingly capable robots with enhanced senses , dexterity , and intelligence used to automate tasks or augment humansAdvanced robotics Devices or systems that store energy for later use , including batteriesEnergy storage Additive manufacturing techniques to create objects by printing layers of material based on digital models3D printing Materials designed to have superior characteristics ( e . g . , strength , weight , conductivity ) or functionalityAdvanced materials Exploration and recovery techniques that make extraction of unconventional oil and gas economical Generation of electricity from renewable sources with reduced harmful climate impactRenewable energyRapid entry into new markets 1 Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomics1 , 020 1 , 600 1 , 3303 , 720 3 , 750 5 . 1 4 . 7 3 . 8 2 . 9 2 . 6 2 . 2 1 . 7 1 . 3 0 0 0 0002 , 1502 , 700 2 , 880 1 , 550 220 3 , 220 720 2 , 500 1 , 100 750 1 , 020 1 , 680 1 , 020510 1 , 140 960 2 , 700 380 330 300 280 170 70100220602109019014033050540420240350 27050170 12011 . 429 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldFI GURE 14 : F R AMEWORK FOR COL LABORATIVE AC TIO n $ BillionImpacted by cybersecurity risks Business & technology innovation total 1Estimate does not include consumer surplus ; based on IMF : April 2013 WEO data & MGI Internet Matters report ; May 2011 2Based on MGI Disruptive Technologies projections for 2025 assuming linear ramp - up from mid - 2013 to 2025 and scaling back to 2020 3Based on MGI Social Economy projections for mid - 2012 , extrapolated to 2020 based on 10 - year average world GDP growth rate 2 . 6 % 4 > 80 % of impact for cloud is due to delayed adoption of public cloud Source : MGI disruptive technologies , social economy & Internet Matters reports , UNCTAD direct investment , IMF global GDP , McKinsey Economic Analytics Platform , Industry leader interviews ( 100 + ) Internet of things Mobile internet Social technologies E - commerce Advanced robotics Energy storage 3D printing Advanced materials Renewable energyRapid entry into new markets Automation of knowledge work Autonomous & near - autonomous vehicles Advanced oil and gas exploration & recoveryNext - generation genomicsCloud technologyMuddling Cyber resilience BacklashImpact of alternative future scenarios Est . value created by 2020 ( 130 ) \u2013 ( 470 ) 4 ( 90 ) \u2013 ( 210 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 150 ) ( 10 ) ( 80 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 20 ) ( 10 ) - - - - - - ( 390 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 410 ) 4 ( 270 ) \u2013 ( 630 ) ( 210 ) \u2013 ( 450 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 240 ) \u2013 ( 310 ) ( 70 ) \u2013 ( 100 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) ( 10 ) \u2013 ( 70 ) ( 20 ) \u2013 ( 40 ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 , 020 1 , 600 2 , 500 750 1 , 0202 5402420 1 , 020 1 , 680272021 , 55021 , 3302 , 15022 , 7002 170 501 270 24013503 120 50 3302 140 1902 90 2102 60 2202 100 7029 , 630 - 21 , 630 ( 410 ) \u2013 ( 1 , 020 ) ( 1 , 230 ) \u2013 ( 3 , 060 ) Full value capturedExample . Consider cloud computing . In a best - case scenario , in which a solid cyber resilience ecosystem accelerates digitization , the private and public sectors see greater use of public cloud technologies , with enhanced security capabilities for non - critical workloads . Better use of private clouds handles critical workloads . Both public and private clouds continue to offer similar features . Enhanced security for private clouds comes at minimal performance penalty , and at a more noticeable performance penalty for public clouds . Under this case , cloud computing has the potential to create US $ 3 . 72 trillion in value by 2020 . In the baseline \u201c muddling into the future \u201d scenario , however , a different norm governs cloud computing \u2019 s activity and economic potential . Use of public cloud technologies for non - critical workloads grows , as does use of private clouds for critical workloads . But fear of data breaches hampers use of public clouds for critical workloads . Delayed adoption of cloud computing means that between US $ 130 billion and US $ 470 billion of potential economic value remains unrealized . Similarly , in the second scenario in which stepped - up cyberattacks , security gaps and a resulting rise in regulations create a backlash against digitization , public clouds are underutilized due to fears of vulnerabilities and higher costs from compliance with stricter policies on third - party access to data and systems . Achieving the full value potential of cloud computing is postponed by three years , and falls short by as much as US $ 1 . 4 trillion . In coming years , annual spending on cyber resilience is likely to rise , from US $ 69 billion in 2013 to US $ 123 billion annually in 2020 . But the extent of the increase and the return on investment will vary . In the best - case scenario , spending swells 13 % , to US $ 139 billion annually , as public and private sectors lift defensive capabilities . In the worst - case scenario , in which US $ 3 trillion of potential economic value is unrealized , global spending nonetheless climbs 28 % above the baseline scenario , to US $ 157 billion annually , as attacks step up and governments force compliance with increasingly complex regulations . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World 3031 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 4 . Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action The Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , recognizes the interdependence of public - and private - sector organizations in today \u2019 s global , hyperconnected environment . Companies participating in this community - led initiative understand the importance of integrating cyber risk management into their day - to - day operations and of sharing information on threats and vulnerabilities . As part of its multistakeholder dialogue across regions and sectors , the partnership also accepts that no static , universal set of actions can address the rapidly evolving environment of cyber risks . The community - led partnership has developed guidelines and principles for companies to build effective cyber risk management programmes . Included in the initiative is a framework tool for chief executive officers and other leaders to pilot internal reviews of their organizations \u2019 cyber resilience capabilities . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate the organization on the five stages of a \u201c hyperconnection readiness curve \u201d . ( See Figure 15 . ) Against this curve leaders can aspire to select from a range of high - value responses to build a robust cyber resilience capability , and benchmark their institutions against best practice . The framework also can prompt discussion about the necessary steps to climb the maturity scale , the attributes against which to set goals , and the actions required to spur cooperation in building a stronger cyber resilience ecosystem . Finally , the framework can serve as a collaborative tool , providing a resource for member organizations through links to existing best practices and specialized organizations such as Interpol and Europol . The maturity - curve framework is a critical starting point for companies to position themselves on the scale of cyber resilience readiness , and the actions they can take to improve . The next phase is to transform the static framework into a community - driven , self - sustaining online conversation . In this way , partners can facilitate the collection and synthesis of cyber resilience expertise across industries , sectors and regions . With a core World Economic Forum team and its partners in an enabling role , the initiative engages participants by first locating their organizations on the cyber resilience readiness curve . The five stages of readiness range from \u201c unaware \u201d ( companies that see cyber risk either as irrelevant or not part of their risk management processes ) to \u201c fully networked \u201d ( industry leaders in managing cyber risk ) . Organizations are advised on the precise steps necessary to move from one level to the next towards a vibrant networked approach to cyber risk management . As strengths and weaknesses are identified , partners are encouraged to share their insights with one another and to actively adapt , improve and build out this framework so that it is broadly applicable and useful , regardless of sector or region . Simultaneously , the core team will proactively s", "validity": false}, {"context": "olicit input from partners who might have insights into specific sectoral cyber risk issues and remedies . The team will serve as a repository for those insights , which can then be used to flesh out the framework in a structured way for broader sharing . The idea is to create a continuous online feedback loop of ever - expanding knowledge to build the framework into a more precise barometer of an organization \u2019 s cyber - readiness and to expand the range of constructive actions that public and private organizations can take to address gaps . Concurrently , a number of tools focus on specific components of the framework . The community is urged to link to these resources rather than create a new set of action items . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience core team will organize regional meetings , project meetings and working group calls to launch and continue this community conversation , and provide the online tools for engagement to partners .

Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative ActionMany leaders in business , civil society and government realize that for the world \u2019 s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation , a robust , coordinated system of global cyber resilience is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks . This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in the private and public sectors , and across different industries , as concerns related to cyber resilience shift from awareness to action . The critical questions today are : what needs to be done , and how can it be achieved ? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World , a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company , assesses the necessary action areas , and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness . The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of cyber resilience . It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews , workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations . It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent , intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust cyber resilience . Finally , the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research , and offers a 14 - point roadmap for collaboration . Chapter 1 . Developing a Clear Set of Action Areas presents a unified agenda for key action areas that global leaders across the spectrum of private and public sectors and civil society can collectively explore to increase cyber resilience . Based on the interviews , workshops and dialogues with senior global executives and thought leaders , this chapter is intended to serve as an ongoing , evolving resource to be continually developed and improved over time . Discussions to date have produced a series of action areas for leaders to consider , organized as required solutions . Chapter 2 . Findings : Understanding Cyber Risks and Response Readiness examines at key findings from the interviews and workshops , with a particular focus on institutional readiness . Pervasive digitization , open and interconnected technology environments , and sophisticated attackers , among other drivers , mean that the risk from major cyber events could materially slow the pace of technological innovation over the coming decade . Addressing the problem will require collaboration across all participants in the \u201c cyber resilience ecosystem \u201d . But many questions remain on direction and responsibilities . In contrast , a much clearer picture is emerging of the actions that institutions should take to protect themselves . They should act now to enhance capabilities while a broader model for resiliency develops . Finally , given the strategic decisions required , chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , government ministers and other key stakeholders from civil society must engage directly with one another to put the right policies and plans in place . Findings from the research include : - R isks of cyberattacks are starting to have a business impact . Controls put in place to protect information assets have at least a \u201c moderate \u201d impact on front - line employee productivity for nearly 90 % of institutions . Moreover , security concerns are already making companies delay implementation of cloud and mobile technology capabilities . And while direct cyber resilience spend represents only a small share of total enterprise technology expenditure , some chief information officers ( CIOs ) and chief information security officers 3 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World ( CISOs ) estimate that indirect or unaccounted security requirements drive as much as 20 - 30 % of overall technology spending , crowding other projects that could create business value . - C urrent trends could result in a backlash against d igitization , with huge economic impact . Major technology t rends like massive analytics , cloud computing and big d ata could create between US $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 t rillion in value for the global economy . If attacker so phistication outpaces defender capabilities \u2013 resulting i n more destructive attacks \u2013 a wave of new regulations a nd corporate policies could slow innovation , with an a ggregate economic impact of around US $ 3 trillion . - L arge institutions lack the facts and processes to make a nd implement effective decisions about cyber resilience . O verall , a large majority of firms have only nascent or d eveloping cyber risk management capabilities . Most l arge institutions do not systematically understand which i nformation assets need to be protected , who are their a ttackers , what is their risk appetite or which is the most e ffective set of defence mechanisms . Companies that s pend more on cyber resilience do not necessarily m anage cyber resilience risks in a more mature way \u2013 m any are simply throwing money at the problem . - M ore collaboration required , but key questions remain . A lmost all CIOs and CISOs say they cannot \u201c do it alone \u201d . T hey believe a broader cyber resilience ecosystem must b e put in place that spans not only the enterprise users of t echnology , but also technology providers , regulators , law e nforcement and other related institutions . However , v iews vary widely on the responsibilities and effectiveness o f several possible public - sector actions . Chapter 3 . Future Scenarios presents three alternative settings for 2020 , and is based on the opinions and thoughts gleaned from the interviews and extensive workshop sessions . The scenarios estimate the conceivable value created from technological innovations that could be affected by a changing cyber resilience environment : - S cenario One : Muddling into the Future . In this baseline s cenario , attackers retain an advantage over defenders w ho continue to respond to threats reactively , albeit s uccessfully . The level of threat increases incrementally , a nd more sophisticated attack tools consistently leave d efenders behind attackers . Adoption of innovative t echnologies slows . In this scenario , as much as US $ 1 . 02 t rillion in value from technological innovation is left u nrealized over the next five to seven years . - S cenario Two : Backlash Decelerates Digitization . In this s cenario , the frequency of attacks significantly escalates , a nd international cooperation to combat the proliferation o f attack tools proves elusive . Government cyber r esilience regulations become more directive , disturbing a doption of innovative technologies . As much as US $ 3 t rillion in potential value creation from these technologies re mains unrealized . - S cenario Three : Cyber Resilience Accelerates Digitization . I n this scenario , proactive action from the public and p rivate sectors limits the proliferation of attack tools , builds i nstitutional capabilities and stimulates innovation . A vital c yber resilience ecosystem serves to facilitate and c onnect company operations . Technological innovation is e nabled , accelerating digitization and creating between U S $ 9 . 6 trillion and US $ 21 . 6 trillion in value over the r emainder of this decade . Chapter 4 : Conclusions and Roadmap for Collaborative Action proposes a framework for collaboration and suggests a path forward . Acknowledging the interdependence of the public and private sectors in today \u2019 s hyperconnected milieu , the Forum \u2019 s Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched in 2012 , has developed a framework to help chief executives and other leaders to build effective cyber risk management platforms . The tool offers a rough composite score to locate an organization on the five stages of maturity . By assessing their positions on the maturity scale , companies can make the necessary plans and take the necessary action to enhance their cyber resilience . A core Forum team and its partners will enable and advise participants in their approach to cyber risk management . The team also will be a storehouse for insights garnered from participants that can be used to build up the framework for broader sharing .

Three observations help to put this in context : 1 . Cyber resilience is not an isolated issue . Cyber resilience is part of a much broader transformation across society driven by information and communication technologies . The term \u201c digital hyperconnectivity \u201d refers to the increasing or exponential rate at which people , processes and things are connecting to the Internet . This results in some key shifts : - T he impact of technology shifts from improving efficiency t o enabling transformation of business operations and institutions . - T he structure of systems changes fundamentally , away f rom hierarchies towards networks . - D isintermediation offers huge social and economic gains , b ut presents new governance and assurance challenges . 2 . Cyber resilience is not a single issue . When referring to cyber resilience or cybersecurity , it is easy to assume that a single topic or issue is meant . However , these terms refer to a set of issues that are as varied as they are distinct . One Internet may connect people , but the challenges are several . In the \u201c real \u201d world , retail fraud , organized crime , invasions of personal privacy , diplomacy , warfare , intellectual property and copyright violations , terrorism and activism happen in very different ways , and different governance mechanisms ( such as institutions , treaties , regulations and market mechanisms ) have evolved to deal with each of them . Of course , part of the challenge of the \u201c virtual \u201d world is that Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today . Social interaction , healthcare activity , political engagement or economic decision - making \u2013 digital connectivity permeates it all , and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly . Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another . As the new , shared digital space evolves , the collective imperative is to develop a common set of expectations to address systemic risks , and to define not only the roles but also the responsibilities of all participants in the cyber ecosystem . The obligations will encompass several key issues \u2013 from privacy norms to Internet governance policy \u2013 but the collective ability to manage cyber risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental . It forms the crux of cyber resilience . these mechanisms in their current form are not reliable .

The common notion of security implies isolation , the protection of a defined perimeter or an objective defined by the prevention of an event .

Cyber resilience is a socio - economic issue . Most critically , the realization is growing that cyber resilience is also a socio - economic issue , although it has been more commonly recognized as a technical and political issue . From the digitally enabled car to smart cities , from energy infrastructure to air travel , from cashless banking to on - the - spot market prices for farmers in developing economies , humankind is witnessing an explosion of innovation in technology . This groundswell of creativity is not centred solely in Silicon Valley , but is occurring across industries everywhere . The phenomenon has massive potential to generate economic value . And many of its gains in recent years have derived directly from digital global connectivity . Discussions of cyber risks tend to focus on doomsday scenarios or a feared \u201c cybergeddon \u201d . However , an equivalent concern perhaps should be the lost opportunities from a significant backlash or fragmentation of the current digital ecosystem . A backlash could result from a single major event , or through gradual erosion . Governments , businesses or individuals could cause it . Fragmentation could occur intentionally , as loss of trust leads to explicitly isolationist policies . Or it could occur semi - intentionally , as governments adopt increasingly protectionist stances on digitally enabled services . Or it could occur unintentionally , as uncoordinated policy developments in different jurisdictions result in a disparate set of requirements to operate globally . Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World examines the link between responses to cyber resilience concerns and the creation of real economic value . If cyber resilience is a potential risk to growth and competitiveness , it is also an enabler . Countries and companies that invest in and develop cyber capabilities to instil trust in customers , citizens and investors will have a c ompetitive edge in this digital era . This report also outlines the key action areas for leaders across private , public and civil society to drive collective cyber capabilities and resilience .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World6 Fact base Deliverables for Davos 2014Interviews with industry leaders \u2022 Conducted 250 + interviews with industry leaders across \u2013 7 + sectors ( e . g . , FS1 , healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americas , EMEA2 , and Asia ) , and \u2013 5 + roles ( e . g . , CISOs , CIOs , CTOs , CROs , VPs ) \u2022 Captured responses of industry leaders ( subset of above ) to questionnaire assessing risks and implications of cybersecurityCyber resilience drivers \u2022 Leveraged fact base from interviews , CRMS , and experience to develop , prioritize , and synthesize list of 20 + drivers that impact cyber resilience Alternative future scenarios \u2022 Derived 3 alternative future scenarios based on realistic varied outcomes of synthesized cyber resilience driversCyber risk maturity survey ( CRMS ) \u2022 Compared cyber resilience of 100 + large / f_irms ( primarily > $ 5B market cap ) with best - practices across \u2013 Multiple sectors ( primarily FS and healthcare ) \u2013 3 regions ( Americans , EMEA , Asia ) , and Experience from client engagements \u2022 Developed business - focused cyber resilience strategies , operating models , vendor strategies and conducted realistic cyber - event simulations to improve responses to real attacks with the world \u2019 s largest / f_irms and institutionsEstimated global economic impact \u2022 Estimated impact of cyber resilience to adoption of signi / f_icant business and technology innovations in 3 alternative future scenarios \u2013 List of key business and technology innovations and their value \u2013 Impact to adoption of business and technology innovations estimated through interviews with industry leaders Potential actions \u2022 Developed a set of coordinated actions for private - and public - sector stakeholders to improve cyber resilience across four areas \u2013 Institutional readiness \u2013 Information sharing \u2013 Critical infrastructure \u2013 Policy development 1Financial Services 2Europe , Middle East and AsiaFRoM A BRoA D DATA SET WE BUILT FUTURE SCEnA RIoS , E STIMATED IM pA CT An D DEvELopED p oT EnT IAL ACTI o nS7 Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected WorldChapter 1 .

To foster technology innovation , and continue to reap value from it , a robust cyberresilience ecosystem is required across sectors and institutions . To deter malevolent attackers , companies will have to abandon their current fragmented cyber resilience defences built around reactive \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c compliance \u201d models . Today \u2019 s increasingly digital age needs a step - change in cyberattack response \u2013 cyber resilience models that are characterized by a business - driven , risk - management approach . The Partnership for Cyber Resilience , launched at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos - Klosters , identified three vital areas of robust cyber resilience : information - sharing , critical infrastructure protection , and policy development . During the past year , the group \u2019 s dialogue set a context for these vital areas within a broader readiness framework aimed at building collaboration and coordination . Institutional readiness and the potential action to improve it , form the first of four pillars of this broader structure . The others include public and international policy , community action and systemic action . The latest work , which included interviews , workshops and surveys , has shown that a range of high - value responses exists upon which to build a vigorous cyber resilience capability at the institutional level . This group of institutional readiness responses comprises governance issues , program development and network expansions for private - sector institutions . On the one hand , these responses address an immediate need of executives for specific steps to shore up their companies \u2019 current cyber resilience capabilities and establish critical benchmarks . On the other , the responses can form the core of a cyber resilience model that , over time , can foster companies \u2019 collaboration with partners in public and international policy , as well as community and systemic responses . Strengthening the core is an essential first step to developing effective responses on a broader scale . 1 . Institutional Readiness Governance - pr ioritize information assets based on business risks . M ost institutions lack sufficient insight into the precise i nformation assets they need protected and how to assign p riorities to those assets . Going forward , cyber resilience t eams need to work with business leaders to better u nderstand business risks ( for example , what it means to l ose proprietary information about a new manufacturing p rocess ) across the entire value chain and to set a ppropriate priorities to the underlying information assets . - D evelop deep integration of security into the t echnology environment to drive scalability . Almost e very part of the broader technology environment has an i mpact on an institution \u2019 s ability to protect itself , from a pplication development practices to policies for replacing o ut - dated hardware . Institutions must move from \u201c bolting s ecurity on \u201d to training their entire staff to incorporate s ecurity from the start into technology projects . pr ogram / network development - pr ovide differentiated protection based on the i mportance of assets . As the axiom states , \u201c To protect e verything is to protect nothing . \u201d By implementing d ifferentiated controls , such as encryption and more r igorous passwords , institutions can focus time and r esources on protecting information assets that matter the most . - D eploy active defences to uncover attacks proactively . Massive amounts of information are available a bout potential attacks \u2013 both from external intelligence s ources and from an institution \u2019 s own technology e nvironment . Increasingly , companies will need to develop c apabilities to aggregate and analyse relevant information , a nd use it to appropriately tune defence systems such as firewalls . - T est continuously to improve incident response . An i nadequate response to a breach \u2013 not only from the t echnology team , but also from those in marketing , public a ffairs or customer services \u2013 can be as damaging as the b reach itself because of the adverse reaction it can elicit f rom clients , partners , government regulators and others . T aking a page from the military , institutions should run c ross - functional \u201c cyberwar games \u201d to improve their ability t o respond effectively in real time . - H elp personnel to understand the value of i nformation assets . Users are often the biggest v ulnerability for an institution . They click on links they s hould not , select insecure passwords and send sensitive fi les by e - mail to broad distribution lists . Institutions need t o segment users , and help each group to understand the b usiness risks of the information assets they touch every day .Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World8 - Int egrate cyber resistance into enterprise - wide risk m anagement and governance processes . Cyber r esilience is an enterprise risk , and must be managed like o ne . Assessments of risks from cyberattack must be i n tegrated with other risk analysis and presented at r elevant management and board discussions . Cyber r esilience implications must be integrated into the broad s et of enterprise governance functions such as human r esources , vendor management and regulatory compliance . The importance of these actions was highlighted in interviews with chief information security officers ( CISOs ) and other executives . Across the board , executives gave their institutions poor average marks for executing these critical responses ( see Figure 1 ) . As a group , these institutional readiness actions can also serve as benchmarks and form a core of expanded cyber resilience collaboration with t", "validity": false}]}]}]}]
